# MTN

MTN (More Than Necessary) is a SDV Map Framework that aims to provide four goals.

- Creative Freedom in Map Making
Originally, map making farm maps required following a particular order. A map modder could not be able to move the farm house, green house, or other objects of static nature. Doing so would cause such things to become broken or act strange (example: Even if the interaction point of the farm house is moved, the farm house would be placed in its original location). MTN solves these problems that map makers faced, giving support and redirecting game logic. Map Makers can:

  * Move objects that were previously static in nature (Greenhouse, Farmhouse, Shipping Bin, Entry/Exit points, etc)
  * Override the warp points on neighboring farm maps
  * Override / Patch up existing maps entirely.
  * Allow XNB or TBIN map loading
  * Set a particular amount of cabins to be created at the creation of a co-op game.
  * Set rules for spawning particular monsters at night (Future release: MTN 1.3)
  * Set rules for spawning Ores (Like the Hilltop Map) and Gem Nodes (Future release: MTN 1.3)
  * Set rules for spawning Forage items (Mushrooms, Coconuts, Spring Onions, etc)
  * Set rules for spawning Large Resource Items (Boulders, Logs, Stumps)
  * Etc

- Manages custom farm maps/types.
Stardew Valley only allows 5 particular farm maps at all times. Originally, most map modders would simply replace an existing farm map with their own. This is no longer needed, as MTN will manage and support an arbitrary amount of custom farm maps/types along with the original five maps. In addition, players have the ability to control the spawn of debris they start with.

- Allows players to change the exterior look of their Farm house / Cabin, mid game. (Future Release: MTN 1.3)
If a player wanted to change the look of their house, they would download a mod that simply replaces the look. MTN provides the ability for a player to interact with Robin, shop for a certain exterior look (whatever mod they would have installed for it), pay the fee and have it changed in three days, just like if Robin was building something.

- Enhance Multiplayer. Allows Custom Maps and Custom Farms in Multiplayer.
The biggest (and potentially most popular) feature with MTN is the support it provides for custom maps, and custom farm maps in Multiplayer. MTN handles all the needed logic for custom maps and custom farms to function correctly. This enable particular maps to occur in Multiplayer:

  * Farm Expansion maps can now exist in Multiplayer
  * Buildings can exist on Farm Expansion maps, and farmhands will not crash.
  * Animals can be placed in buildings in Farm Expansion maps.
  * Cabins can exist on a Farm Expansion map, and be usable
  * Cabins can exist on ANY Buildable Map, it does not have to just be a farm.
  * Etc...
  
In addition, MTN enhances multiplayer with modding in general by:
  * Kicking a player (Future Release: MTN 1.3)
  * Banning a player (Future Release: MTN 1.3)
  * Blacklisting certain mods when a player connects (Future Release: MTN 1.3)
  * Prohibiting cheating mods when a player connects (Future Release: MTN 1.3)
  * Informs a player if he's missing a vital mod on connection (Future Release: MTN 1.3)
